# #Freedom in the World - Week 8

The data this week comes from [Freedom House](https://freedomhouse.org/reports/publication-archives) and [Arthur Cheib](https://github.com/ArthurCheib/analytical-politics-project/blob/main/data/tidy-data-fh-un.csv). 

I'm visualizing data on the change in civil liberties scores across the 10 largest countries in the Americas from 1995-2020.This code should render the image as a gif but can also be edited to be a static image.
