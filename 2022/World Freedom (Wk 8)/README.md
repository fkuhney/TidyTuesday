# #Freedom in the World - Week 8

The data this week comes from [Freedom House](https://freedomhouse.org/reports/publication-archives) and [Arthur Cheib](https://github.com/ArthurCheib/analytical-politics-project/blob/main/data/tidy-data-fh-un.csv). 
Freedom in the World, Freedom House's flagship publication, is the standard-setting comparative assessment of global political rights and civil liberties.

I'm visualizing data on the change in civil liberties, specifically, around the world over time.
This code should render the image as a gif but can also be edited to be a static image.
